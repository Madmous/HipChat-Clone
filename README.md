## Description

[HipChat](http://hipchat.com) clone being built with MongoDB, Vuejs, React, NodeJS.

I am a fan of Software Craftmanship, TDD, BDD and CI practices; therefore this project's main goal is to follow 
all the coding standard and best practices.

## Main technologies

* MongoDB
* Express
* Vuejs
* NodeJS

## Support

* Star the repo
* Follow me on twitter [@datmadmmous](https://twitter.com/datmadmous)
* Submit pull requests and improve the repo overall quality

## Prerequisite

Before you install the project, make sure [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (prefered one) or Npm 
and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/administration/install-community/) are installed.

## Installation instructions

Once your package management is installed these commands will run your application.

1. Database

  `mongod` : handles data requests, manages data access and performs background management operations.
  
  `mongo` : starts the mongo shell and connect to your MongoDB instance running on localhost with default port.
  
1. Server
  
  `cd server`
  
  `yarn install`
  
  `yarn start`

2. Client

They are awesome and they care about open source.

## Inspiration

## Contribution guidelines

1. Start with the open issues
1. No direct commit on master or develop.
2. Create a branch from develop with issue number as a name. Exemple: TOC I#1 (TOC = HipChat Clone and I = issue)
4. Code should be accompined with unit tests with 100% code coverage (whether it is on the client side or the server side).
5. Make a pull request.
6. End to end testing are not required for now.

## Next release (1.0.0)
